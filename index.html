                <p>Sometimes people say things to you at just the right time that will change your life forever. Perhaps it was a coincidence, perhaps it was all part of the master plan. I like to think that everyone you meet in life was for a reason.
             You learned something from that person, no matter how big or little the lesson may have been.

                <p>I was 13 years old, trying to teach my 6 year old sister how to dive into a swimming pool from the side of the pool. It was taking quite a while as my sister was really nervous about it. We were at a big, public pool, 
                    and nearby there was a woman, about 75 years old, slowly swimming laps. Occasionally she would stop and watch us. Finally she swam over to us just when I was really putting the pressure on, trying to get my sister to try the dive, 
                    and my sister was shouting, "but I'm afraid!! I'm so afraid!!" The old woman looked at my sister, raised her fist defiantly in the air and said,<b> "So be afraid! And then do it anyway!"</b>That was 35 years ago and I have never forgotten it. 
                    It was a revelation -- it's not about being unafraid. It's about being afraid and doing it anyway.

             <li><p>I met a person who was in a wheelchair. He related a story about how a person once asked if it was difficult to be confined to a wheelchair. He responded,<b> "I'm not confined to my wheelchair - I am liberated by it. If it wasn't for my wheelchair, 
                 I would be bed-bound and never able to leave my room or house."</b> Amazing perspective.</p>

                <li><p>My dad was a deacon of a church, and one part of his duties was to visit with people in retirement homes and bring them communion. He couldn't go one day, and he asked me (I was in high school at the time) to go in his place. Perhaps obviously, 
                with me being young and the people in the homes being elderly, age was a frequent topic of conversation. One old man told me,<b> "The hardest thing about getting old is running out of people who understand you."</b> That is, 
                each generation has a unique way of looking at the world and what it means to be alive in it, and as new generations come and redefine what the world is, one's world gets smaller and smaller as there are fewer people around who understand your world in the same way.</p>

            <li><p>When I was 38 I contemplated beginning a two year Associates Degree in Radiography. I was talking to a friend and had almost talked myself out of doing it. I said "I'm too old to start that. I'll be 40 when I get my degree." My friend said<b> "If you don't do it,
                 you'll still be 40, but without the degree."</b> I'm nearly 60 now, and that degree has been the difference between making a decent living, and struggling to get by.</p>

                <li><p>A mother and a baby camel were lying around under a tree.
                    
                    Then the baby camel asked, "Why do camels have humps?"
                    
                    The mother camel considered this and said, "We are desert animals so we have the humps to store water so we can survive with very little water."
                    
                    The baby camel thought for a moment then said, "Ok...why are our legs long and our feet rounded?"
                    
                    The mama replied, "They are meant for walking in the desert."
                    
                    The baby paused. After a beat, the camel asked, "Why are our eyelashes long? Sometimes they get in my way."
                    
                    The mama responded, Those long thick eyelashes protect your eyes from the desert sand when it blows in the wind.
                    
                    The baby thought and thought. Then he said, "I see. So the hump is to store water when we are in the desert, the legs are for walking through the desert and these eye lashes protect my eyes from the desert then why in the Zoo?"
